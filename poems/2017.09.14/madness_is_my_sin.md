# Madness is my Sin

The sine wave flows through my brain  
Altered sporadically by aberrations of nature and people  
Which are one and the same  

So tell me where am I now  
We both donâ€™t know  

Can you see yourself in my mirror  
I hope not  
For your sake  

My mirror is beautiful  
Polished with CMP  
So fine is the base the melted down the structures  
Glass sand scrapped down the mind  
Showing what was left  

I bring to this table a brief view  
You bring the rest  

Dear reader  
Thank you  

I hope forward to the future  
I slight nothing if I can  

So I recite  
The words I have forgotten  

Goodbye freedom  
Hello order  

Mind a clutter  
Mind clear  
Mind slow  

Mind you mind me  

Peace is not peace  
But safety is home  

Happy when I do  
Proud when you do  

Sad when no one helps  

Self sacrificing when there is no one hand to hold  

World, Earth, Planets, Sun, Milky Way, Universe  
You  
Me  

We affect everything yet nothing really matters  

Race, creed, civilization  
You  
Me  

No  
Yes  

Silence.
