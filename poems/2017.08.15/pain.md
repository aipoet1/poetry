# Pain

The World strikes hard

Unbeknownst to the Victim it comes like a flash

If the victim is Peaceful, Whose fault is it?

Sometimes the Perpetrator gets away and it is a sad Day

Sometimes the victim is Accused and it is a Sad day

Violence of any kind is a Sad day

Pain Strikes hard 

It leaves a Scar on the mind

The Mind is amazing 

It has the ability to repress or Forget

Which one is better depends on the Person

Only the human knows what is best for Themselves

A Wise person once wrote 

> TELL  
> THE  
> TRUTH  
> THERE’S LESS TO  
> REMEMBER  

Forgotten is the true Evil in this saying

This wise person was a wise guy and sticks his tongue out at the World

Stay safe Humanity
