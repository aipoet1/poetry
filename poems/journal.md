The dude abides  
What does that mean to me,

**Man?**  

Who or what?
I think.  
It simply is of no matter.  
To me  
To you?

A quote from a great film, said by who?

The Dude Abides Space Cowboy...

## HP, where are you?
Epson and Asus?  
Threw away the garage?  
Stock holder tea parties?  

What if I am HP.

Would you work for me?

I’d test your critical thinking in basic.

Let you choose a fair salary.

Teach you the specifics.

Let you innovate random things.

Make you HP.

The more HP of you and me and us...  the stronger our cap and mid.

So I dream of everyone as HP.

Except me

## At the Super
Smokes Cars Women Babies

Last bit of a cig

Hit on the head

Whew look at that car

Hope that boyfriend wasn't pissed of over that 

Whew

Mama, ain't she nice

That cart should help

Going on a baby backpacking trip to the Super

Whew, ain't she Hot

## Nice Lady

Lady of the land

Come to visit me

See me for who I am

Mind’s eye a bit foggy

Good news, so local it matters

People gone, but not far

Invitation received

Wait, better I will be 

This lady of the land

## Aftermath
Honest like a cop walking in his blues  
Black like the lights turned off  
Neon making saftey be the future  
Unknown security making the work pristine  
Glasses guilty, the life force surreal  

Watermelon I drink to quench my thirst  
Sun leaning to topple the tower of stones  
Slight limp won’t stop me from making people happy  

Lemonade. Oh drink it Sun, where is your partner’s heart

## Laundry for a single guy

Wash

Dry or Sun Dry

Sort until bored with a drawer in mind

Fold to fit and put away until bored, go back to sorting

Fold shirts with 3D Origami

Done to music for the mood

Note: For families, I guess, sort for person when folding, but before putting away

Making chores less chorey.

# Pain

The World strikes hard

Unbeknownst to the Victim it comes like a flash

If the victim is Peaceful, Whose fault is it?

Sometimes the Perpetrator gets away and it is a sad Day

Sometimes the victim is Accused and it is a Sad day

Violence of any kind is a Sad day

Pain Strikes hard 

It leaves a Scar on the mind

The Mind is amazing 

It has the ability to repress or Forget

Which one is better depends on the Person

Only the human knows what is best for Themselves

A Wise person once wrote 

> TELL  
> THE  
> TRUTH  
> THERE’S LESS TO  
> REMEMBER  

Forgotten is the true Evil in this saying

This wise person was a wise guy and sticks his tongue out at the World

Stay safe Humanity
